### See how _the exact same_ Medium.com clone (called [Conduit](https://conduit.realworld.how)) is built using different [frontends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=frontend) and [backends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=backend). Yes, you can mix and match them, because **they all adhere to the same [API spec](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/backend-specs/introduction)** ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜Ž

While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build _real_ applications with it.

**RealWorld** solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React, Angular, & more) and any backend (Node, Django, & more) and see how they power a real-world, beautifully designed full-stack app called [**Conduit**](https://conduit.realworld.how).
