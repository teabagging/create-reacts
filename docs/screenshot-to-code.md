## üõ† Getting Started

The app has a React/Vite frontend and a FastAPI backend.

Keys needed:

- [OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4](https://github.com/abi/screenshot-to-code/blob/main/Troubleshooting.md)
- Anthropic key (optional) - only if you want to use Claude Sonnet, or for experimental video support.

Run the backend (I use Poetry for package management - `pip install poetry` if you don't have it):

```bash
cd backend
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" > .env
poetry install
poetry shell
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload --port 7001
```

If you want to use Anthropic, add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `backend/.env`. You can also set up the keys using the settings dialog on the front-end (click the gear icon after loading the frontend).

Run the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to use the app.

If you prefer to run the backend on a different port, update VITE_WS_BACKEND_URL in `frontend/.env.local`

For debugging purposes, if you don't want to waste GPT4-Vision credits, you can run the backend in mock mode (which streams a pre-recorded response):

```bash
MOCK=true poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload --port 7001
```

## Docker

If you have Docker installed on your system, in the root directory, run:

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" > .env
docker-compose up -d --build
```

The app will be up and running at http://localhost:5173. Note that you can't develop the application with this setup as the file changes won't trigger a rebuild.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è FAQs

- **I'm running into an error when setting up the backend. How can I fix it?** [Try this](https://github.com/abi/screenshot-to-code/issues/3#issuecomment-1814777959). If that still doesn't work, open an issue.
- **How do I get an OpenAI API key?** See https://github.com/abi/screenshot-to-code/blob/main/Troubleshooting.md
- **How can I configure an OpenAI proxy?** - If you're not able to access the OpenAI API directly (due to e.g. country restrictions), you can try a VPN or you can configure the OpenAI base URL to use a proxy: Set OPENAI_BASE_URL in the `backend/.env` or directly in the UI in the settings dialog. Make sure the URL has "v1" in the path so it should look like this: `https://xxx.xxxxx.xxx/v1`
- **How can I update the backend host that my front-end connects to?** - Configure VITE_HTTP_BACKEND_URL and VITE_WS_BACKEND_URL in front/.env.local For example, set VITE_HTTP_BACKEND_URL=http://124.10.20.1:7001
- **Seeing UTF-8 errors when running the backend?** - On windows, open the .env file with notepad++, then go to Encoding and select UTF-8.
- **How can I provide feedback?** For feedback, feature requests and bug reports, open an issue or ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_abi_).
