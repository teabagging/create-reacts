See [Addon / Framework Support Table](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/frameworks-feature-support)

To continue improving your experience, we have to eventually deprecate or remove certain addons in favor of new and better tools.

If you're using info/notes, we highly recommend you migrate to [docs](code/addons/docs/) instead, and [here is a guide](code/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md#migrating-from-notesinfo-addons) to help you.

If you're using contexts, we highly recommend you migrate to [toolbars](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/addons/toolbars) and [here is a guide](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#deprecated-addon-contexts) to help you.

If you're using addon-storyshots, we highly recommend you migrate to the Storybook [test-runner](https://github.com/storybookjs/test-runner) and [here is a guide](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/storyshots-migration-guide) to help you.

### Development scripts

Storybook is organized as a monorepo. Useful scripts include:

#### `yarn start`

> Runs a sandbox template storybook with test stories

#### `yarn task`

> As above, but gives you options to customize the sandbox (e.g. selecting other frameworks)

#### `yarn lint`

> boolean check if code conforms to linting rules - uses remark & eslint

- `yarn lint:js` - will check js
- `yarn lint:md` - will check markdown + code samples
- `yarn lint:js --fix` - will automatically fix js

#### `yarn test`

> boolean check if unit tests all pass - uses jest

- `yarn run test --core --watch` - will run core tests in watch-mode
